### Design & Fit Adjustments
All parts have been **size-adjusted** to account for Velcro strips that will be attached along the sides.  
As a result, the components may not appear to fit perfectly within the compartments at this stage.  
The fit will be tested on the first aircraft, and adjustments will be made as needed for subsequent drones.  

### Upper Plate Modifications
The **receiver fit** on the upper plate requires improvement, as it is currently too loose.  
A **hole must be drilled** to allow the receiver wires to pass through the sides of the FPV camera compartment bulge.  
While drilling the hole should be straightforward, improving the receiverâ€™s tightness will require some creativity with velcro at the moment.  

### Rear Compartment Plate
A **prototypical design** for the rear compartment plate exists, but it is not finalized.  
Since the rear compartment is primarily intended to house the ESC, the addition of a plate is not essential at this stage.  
If future requirements justify it, the design can be completed and provided.
